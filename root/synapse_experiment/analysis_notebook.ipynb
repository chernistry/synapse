    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the results of a synthetic experiment designed to compare two AI agents in a resource-constrained pathfinding problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`StaticAgent`**: A control group agent that uses a fixed, predefined set of weights to evaluate path efficiency vs. safety.\n",
    "2.  **`SYNAPSEAgent`**: An experimental agent that dynamically adapts its evaluation metrics based on the perceived risk of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core hypothesis is that the `SYNAPSEAgent`'s adaptive governance will lead to solutions with a higher **Product Performance Score (PPS)**, especially in complex scenarios where safety is a critical factor. The PPS is a composite metric reflecting the ultimate goals of a stakeholder, with a heavy weighting on safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: To load the experimental data, analyze the performance of both agents, and visualize the results to validate our hypothesis."

The `StaticAgent`'s performance is highly volatile, with many outliers showing very poor scores. This indicates that while the static approach can sometimes succeed (likely in simple scenarios), it frequently fails catastrophically when faced with complex challenges. SYNAPSE, on the other hand, provides consistently good-to-excellent results."

    "1.  **Adaptive strategy is superior**: Dynamically adjusting priorities based on context outperforms a static approach.\n",
    "2.  **Risk is managed effectively**: SYNAPSE avoids the catastrophic failures that plague the static model.\n",
    "3.  **Performance is generalizable**: The advantage holds on unseen data, proving true adaptability.\n",
